Project 2: AMES Iowa Housing Dataset

The following project focuses on the housing data for the city of Ames in Iowa.

Through exploratory data anlaysis I have cleaned the data to allow for multiple modeling techniquest to be performed.
- Linear Regression
- GridSearch Ridge
- GridSearch Lasso
- GridSearch Elastic Net

Through running each of the above mentioned models I found the optimal model to be the GridSeach Ridge technique.

From this modeling I then was able to perform some data analysis on if the neighborhood in which you live, within Ames, influences the Sale Price of your home. Through my analysis I did find that the Neighborhoods who had the highest home Sale Prices shared the most correlation to the features that were showing in my model as having the largest affect on why a home is higher priced.
